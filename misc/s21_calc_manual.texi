@chapter @strong{ | About}
This is a @strong{School 21} educational project - an implementation of a @strong{classic calculator} in @strong{C programming language}.
The calculator takes a string with an arithmetical expression as input and computes the expression using the @strong{reverse Polish notation}.
It can also plot a graph for the expression if a certain mode is chosen or a variable "x" is inserted into the equation.

@strong{Supported mathematical operations and functions:}
@enumerate
@item
unary plus | +a
@item
unary minus | -a
@item
addition | a + b
@item
substraction | a - b
@item
multiplication | a * b
@item
division | a / b
@item
power | a ^ b
@item
modulo | a % b
@item
parentheses | ()
@item
cosine | cos(x)
@item
sine | sin(x)
@item
tangent | tan(x)
@item
arc cosine | acos(x)
@item
arc sine | asin(x)
@item
arc tangent | atan(x)
@item
square root | sqrt(x)
@item
natural logarithm | ln(x)
@item
common logarithm | log(x)

@chapter @strong{| Installation and usage:}

@strong{s21_calc} has been developed as a desktop application for MacOS and Linux, and has been tested on @strong{MacOS (Big Sur)} and @strong{Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)}, @strong{Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)}, both Desktop and Server images. 

To compile, run "make" from the root folder of the project in the terminal. On Linux OS, all the required package dependencies can be installed with @strong{linux_package_installer.sh} script located in the @strong{utils/} folder of the project.


For additional usage instructions, run the compiled application with the @strong{[-h]} option.
